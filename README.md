Solr sample project
===================

This project uses [flux](https://github.com/mwmitchell/flux), Matt Mitchell's Solr client for Clojure. 
There are a few Solr clients in the Clojure world -- [Icarus](https://github.com/mattdeboard/Icarus), [Clojure-Solr](https://github.com/mikejs/clojure-solr), and [Solrclj](https://github.com/mlehman/solrclj) -- but Flux is the most recent and the only one that supports Solr 4.x out of the box.

It's designed as a quick way to get started, especially if you use IntelliJ IDEA and the [Cursive Clojure](cursiveclojure.com) plugin.

Step 0
------

If you don't have a Clojure setup that you like already, I recommend one of the following: 

1. If you're comfortable with Emacs, go ahead and use that. There's a lot of information about getting started with Emacs on [clojure-doc](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/emacs.html). 

2. If you're not fully conversant in Emacs (and there's no shame in that), I recommend downloading the free Community Edition of [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and the [Cursive](cursiveclojure.com/eap.html) plugin. It's really nice. 
A lot of people also use Eclipse and [Counterclockwise](), so if you're already comfortable with Eclipse, that's a fine option. 

[Download Leiningen](http://leiningen.org), the most common Clojure build tool.
